Hey builders, 

A quick update on the grants program. 
- We're working on our quarterly review report to share on the program's progress
- We are currently not reviewing any new applications until our next review session starting in mid-October, but in the mean time you are welcome to submit your application and we look forward to reviewing it then. 
- We're looking primarly for apps - so if you have a game or killer app, you've got a good chance!
